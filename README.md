# election-sim
## Project Overview
This C++ project simulates a race among political parties to form a coalition with 60 or more mandates. The simulation involves agents, each with different norms and ways of action, competing to create a coalition within a Linux environment.

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the Project Directory.

2. Compile the Project using command line 'make'.
This will create an executable file named cRace inside the folder 'bin'.

3. Run the simulation with one of the provided configurations from the 'tests' folder.
For example:  ./bin/cRace tests/01.json
Choose from the available configurations (e.g., 01.json, 02.json, etc.) to observe different scenarios. Feel free to customize these files or create new ones to explore different scenarios.

4. View Results:
After running the simulation, the results will be stored in an output file inside the tests directory.

## Dependencies
This project has no external dependencies beyond a standard C++ environment.


Feel free to reach out for any feedback, questions or issues related to running the simulation. Happy racing!
